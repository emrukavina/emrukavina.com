# About Me

Hi, I'm a passionate developer with a journey that started in PHP and has evolved into mastering Rust for high-performance server backends. I love building scalable, efficient, and secure systems that power modern applications. My focus is on creating robust APIs, optimizing performance, and ensuring clean, maintainable code.

# My Journey

I began my career as a PHP developer, crafting dynamic web applications and learning the ins and outs of backend development. Over time, I transitioned to Rust to leverage its performance, safety, and concurrency features. Now, I specialize in designing and implementing server-side solutions that handle high loads with minimal latency. Whether it's RESTful APIs, microservices, or database integrations, I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant code.

# Skills

 - **Languages**: Rust, PHP, JavaScript, SQL 
 
 - **Frameworks & Tools**: Actix, Rocket, Tokio (Rust), Laravel (PHP), Docker, PostgreSQL 
 
 - **Concepts**: API Design, Microservices, Concurrency, Performance Optimization 
 
 - **DevOps**: CI/CD, Kubernetes, AWS, Git - Problem-solving and critical thinking - Effective communication and collaboration - Mentoring and knowledge sharing 
 
 - Adaptability to new technologies and challenges

# What I’m Working On

Currently, I'm diving deeper into Rust’s ecosystem, exploring advanced concurrency patterns with Tokio and building fault-tolerant distributed systems. I’m also experimenting with WebAssembly to bring Rust’s power to the browser. Check out my GitHub for my latest projects!

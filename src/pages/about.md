# About Me

Hi, I'm a software dev with a roadmap that started in PHP and has evolved into Rust and high-performance server backends. I love building scalable, efficient, and secure systems that power modern projects.

# My Journey

I began my career as a PHP developer, making dynamic web applications and learning the ins and outs of backend development. Over time, I transitioned to Rust to kinda get into "more" backend. Now, I specialize in designing and implementing server-side solutions. Whether it's RESTful APIs, microservices, or database integrations, I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant code.
